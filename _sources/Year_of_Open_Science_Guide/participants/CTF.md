The Children's Tumor Foundation (CTF) is a firm believer in Open Science and Data Sharing and is very enthusiastic about participating in 2023 as the #YearOfOpenScience initiative. As a private funder in the disease space of NF (a family of rare genetic conditions including neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis), CTF launched the first ever NF Data Portal in 2014, and in 2018 spearheaded the NF Open Science Initiative (NF-OSI). CTF worked collaboratively with all the major NF private funders as well as federal funders (CDMRP, NIH) to centralize access to data for the NF research community in a public repository hosted by Sage Bionetworks. The NF Data Portal allows users to openly explore and share NF datasets, analysis tools, resources, and publications related to neurofibromatosis and schwannomatosis. Anyone can join the NF Open Science Initiative (NF-OSI) to contribute. 

We believe that our standard policies for data sharing and open science, together with other initiatives like the Data Portal, the Drug Discovery Initiative Registered Report (DDIRR) grants, and the implementation of persistent identifiers (DOIs) for grants and data, will accelerate the advancement of our mission to finding a cure for all forms of neurofibromatosis, by democratizing access to data. We are excited to contribute and work with all organizations committed to promoting a complete transition to open science across the entire research ecosystem.
