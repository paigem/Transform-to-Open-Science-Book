# Citations and Further Reading

Thank you for attending a Transform to Open Science workshop on the Ethos of Open Science! We are glad to have been able to share the first module of our [Open Science 101 Certification](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/Open-Science-101) with you, and hope to see you in workshops or virtual forums for the remaining modules on open data, open-source software, open results and tools for conducting open science as soon as they become available. 

If you wish to receive an email when the remaining modules become available, please [join our email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform).

## What is Open Science? 

The definition of open science used by TOPS is from [open.science.gov](https://open.science.gov/) and is:
"Open Science is the principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity." 
Learn more about how NASA defines open science on [our website](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/what-is-open-science/).

Open Science graphics that TOPS uses in the Ethos of Open Science workshop include ["Towards an Open Science" from UNESCO](https://www.scientificinfographics.com/21-towards-an-open-science) and the ["Open Science Skills Visualisation" from the Digital Skills for Library Staff and Researchers (LIBER) Working Group](https://zenodo.org/record/3702401#.Y-_S1uzMKW0).

## Stories of Open Science Successes and Barriers
