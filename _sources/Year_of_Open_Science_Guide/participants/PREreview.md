PREreviewâ€™s mission is to bring more equity and openness to the scholarly evaluation process, centering the needs and expectations of researchers who have been traditionally excluded from the process. Transformative change needs community coordinated efforts with both bottom-up and top-down input. We support NASA and other funding agencies's commitment to celebrating open and equitable scholarly practices, praising and valuing past and ongoing community-led efforts that have brought us where we are today.

Our organizational goals very well align with 2 of the 4 goals set by the Year of Open Science TOPS Mission:

- **Goal 2:** *"Examining the review process and take action to improve the transparency, integrity, and equity of reviews. This could include identifying and measuring the impact of existing bias in the review process."*

- **Goal 4:** *"Engaging with underrepresented communities in the advancement of open science."*

Our work is a direct response to the flawed way scientific research is evaluated. Behind closed doors, a handful of unpaid reviewers use subjective criteria to decide the fate of a research article. This arcane process is slow and disadvantages researchers from historically excluded groups. PREreview closes obvious gaps in the process to make research and how it's evaluated more equitable. We train researchers in reflecting on systemic and personal bias, in giving and receiving feedback, and we provide the tools and resourrces for any researcher to safely engage in open preprint review in a process that is most rewardring to them.

In 2023 we commit to boosting up our efforts to radically listen to the needs of globally diverse research communities, relying on their knowledge and experience to better inform our approach to our mission and methods of implementation.
