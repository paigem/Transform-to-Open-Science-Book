# TOPS' Guide to Open Science

We can all take actions, both big and small, to promote open science in our own work, in how our team's are run, and how our organization's make policy and funding decisions. This living guidebook is here to point our community members towards some of our favorite open science resources, as well as some we have gathered ourselves.
