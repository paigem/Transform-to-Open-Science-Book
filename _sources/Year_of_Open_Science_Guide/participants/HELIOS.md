"The Year of Open Science is a great step forward in promoting productive ways for researchers and scholars to communicate their work more openly and inclusively for the benefit of both science and society," said Dr. Michael Crow, President of Arizona State University and Co-Chair of the Higher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship (HELIOS). "HELIOS is excited to team with NASA to advance this important initiative."

"We are excited to partner with federal agencies to make open science easier and more rewarding for both individuals and the organizations that support them," said Dr. Geeta Swamy, Duke University Associate Vice President for Research and Vice Dean for Scientific Integrity and Strategic Lead for the Higher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship (HELIOS).  "HELIOS member institutions are eager to develop actionable policies, resources, guidance, metrics, and infrastructure to advance open science scholarship.  Cross-sector coordination through initiatives such as the Year of Open Science are critical to harmonizing and scaling these efforts."
